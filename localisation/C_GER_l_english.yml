### SPIRITS
GER_Einheit_Und_Vaterland: "Einheit Und Vaterland"
GER_Einheit_Und_Vaterland_desc: "Our plans are finished. Our plans are complete. The German state possesses a monopoly over Earth, and with it, she possesses the strongest and most united people on the planet. From the shores of Brittany to big cities like Moscow, the citizens of the Reich salute their new commanders and with it, they are strong. They are vigilant. They are encouraged.\n\nThe Führer has instituted plans to reconstruct the economically and politically destroyed Germany. After the war, pro-democratic demonstrations emerged across the country, some turned violent, others remained peaceful. The dissidents we have vow to destroy the coming prosperity of the Reich and instead want to come in check to destroy the colonies and powers that we have in our hands. However, despite these outcasts trying to ruin the scene, the people must remain vigilant and strong and soon, the opposition will perish.\n\n§YSieg Heil!§!"
GER_Hitlerjugend: "Hitlerjugend"
GER_Hitlerjugend_desc: "The generation of Germans has united us forever. The future awaits.\n\nAdolf Hitler set up the Hitlerjugend, or Hitler Youth, in an attempt to teach young Germans how to behave like a German. Fight like a German. Win like a German. The organization is made to teach the Aryan people strong spirits, values, and virtues that closely align with that of our glorious Führer. Thousands of boys and girls have made it into this club and now possess the trust, strength, and virtues of the Führer. These kids will, in the future, become strong and endure through all of their difficulties, no matter the roads they take and the ropes they lead. The kids in this generation of passionately behaved and spiritually minded beings possess the power to become names in the government and be the strongest any may be.\n\n§YDie Zukunft erwartet uns.§!"
GER_Generalplan_Ost: "Generalplan Ost"
GER_Generalplan_Ost_desc: "East, we go.\n\nWith the defeat and obliteration of the scum that was the Bolshevik state in the east, we have begun devising a plan to instate German overlordship in our new colonies, satellite states, and protectorates. We have reorganized the mess of nations and put them all under our command, dissolving any opposition to the ideas and virtues of the Reich. This is the basic idea of the first phase of the plan, which will instate and promote the ideals of the Führer back home and foresee and destroy any insurgent activities that defy orders to concur. The military, in particular the Wehrmacht, Schutzstaffel, and Sicherheitsdienst, will put this stage of Generalplan Ost into action in our newly conquered territories in Slavic Europe."
GER_Beaurecratic_High_Command: "Beaurecratic High Command"
GER_Beaurecratic_High_Command_desc: "You would expect out of a great nation like ours that the military high command would be able to push swift actions and bleed out any corruption that floods the government.\n\nInstead, if anything is being bled out, it's the Führer's trust in the men in charge. Corruption is blatant and rampant throughout the Wehrmacht's high command and leaves a high out of mutual distrust and hatred bleeding the government and the military. In fact, most of our indecent and unskilled high command just bought their way into the job with their money and was accepted by the filthy man we mistakenly appointed in charge of the job; Erwin Rommel.\n\nWith his indecency, distrust, and abuses of power, Rommel is a feared man and is himself a proponent of the corruption and fraud that flows through the high command. Other military leaders who are more capable and trusted by Hitler such as Hermann Göring and Franz Halder have called for the conviction and execution of Rommel, however knowing his name, it's very unlikely that he'll step down."
### LEADERS
GER_Adolf_Hitler_Desc: "Name the man with a monopoly over Europe. Hint; he's admired by many. Hint; he started as a painter in the streets. And final hint; his name is Adolf Hitler.\n\nBorn in Austria, he eventually made a job selling stamps and paintings in the streets. That is, until World War I broke out and Hitler had the opportunity to join the German military and fight for his country. He faced numerous injuries, many of which took him to the hospital. After the war, he served as an informant for the newly established Reichswehr, infiltrating and dissolving political parties that wove red flags. One party didn't wave red flags, but rather wove signs to him. It spoke to him in ways no party had ever done before. That party was the German Workers' Party. He joined and rebranded it, quickly becoming the leader and eventually seizing power in Germany in 1933 and establishing total control two years later.\n\nHe was seen as a god, winning wars with multiple global powers at once, and showing the might of the fearsome German people. Today, he faces the challenge of uniting the German people. With corruption in the military rampant and the people in distress from the war, his challenge might be larger than ever."
